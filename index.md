## About Me

Hi, I am Long Peng (<span style="font-family: 'Ma Shan Zheng', cursive;">å½­é¾™</span>), born in 2001. I pursued my Master's degree at the **University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)** from **2022 to 2024**. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student (**2024â€“2027**) at **USTC**, working under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=gDnBC1gAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Zheng-Jun Zha</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K7rTHNcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN">Associate Prof. Yang Cao</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7TFKCpQAAAAJ">Associate Prof. Yang Wang</a>. 

From October 2023 to October 2024, I interned at **Huawei Noahâ€™s Ark Lab**, where I had the privilege of being supervised by <a href="https://fenglinglwb.github.io/">Dr. Wenbo Li</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zEEMPUUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN">Dr. Renjing Pei</a>. 

**My research interests:** include but are not limited to Real-World Super-Resolution [**Real SR**], Low-Level Vision, and Artificial Intelligence Generated Content [**AIGC**]. 

**If you are interested in my research or have any questions, suggestions, or collaboration ideas, please feel free to contact me at Email: [longp2001@mail.ustc.edu.cn](mailto:longp2001@mail.ustc.edu.cn), WeChat: 17370780725.**
